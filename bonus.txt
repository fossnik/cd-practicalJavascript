# Version 1 - An Array #
- Creates an array in which to store "todo" string values.
  \ Rather awkwardly verbose command statements accommodate simplistic
   |  alterations of a "todo" list (technically an array of strings).
   |  + todos = ['item 1', 'item 2', 'item 3']

# Version 2 - Functions #
- Codifies the means of array manipulation, through functions.
  \ Permits more readily comprehensible command syntax
   |  + displayTodo()     />    console.log(array[index])
   |  + addTodo()         />    push(todoText)
   |  + changeTodo()      />    array[index] = value
   |  + deleteTodo()      />    splice(position, 1)

# Version 3 - Objects #
- Marries the data structure from V1 with the algorithms from V2.
  \ Implements a new Object Class (todoList) comprised from:
   |  + The "todo" array from V1
   |  + The four functions in V2 (the 'methods' of said Object)

# Version 4 - Booleans #
- Replaces the String property of todoList with a new type of Object.
  \ These Newfangled Objects have Two Properties per Each:
   |  + A String property abstracted from the Object established in V3
   |  + A new Boolean value to represent the Object's state (of completion)

# Version 5 - Loops #
- Changes the way objects are printed to facilitate checkmarks.
  \ Iterates through arrays of objects using for loops.
   |  + Set up console.log error message for zerolength array (empty list).
   |  + Modifies displayTodos to print check next to todos .completed = true

# Version 6 - Thinking in Code #
- Parses the truth state of each object's .completed property.
  \ In the case of a totally homogenous set, toggles all booleans to opposite.
   |  + New "toggleAll" function (3 'for' loops):
   |    : Sum the quantity of true .completed values within the todo array.
   |      :: Case 1 :: All true  -> All false
   |      :: Case 2 :: All false -> All true

# Version 7 - HTML and DOM #
- Facilitates access to certain CLI functions via an HTML interface.
  \ Creates index.html file featuring "displayTodos" and "toggleAll" buttons.
   |  + Display todos and Toggle All buttons (with such id=displayTodosButton)
   |  + Create link to script.js at bottom of HTML body.
  \ Modifies the script.js for use with HTML
   |  + Creates a displayTodosButton object, selecting by ID through the DOM
   |  + Adds and event listener to the DOM, to trigger displayTodos upon click.
   |  + Creates a toggleAll button object, selecting by ID through the DOM
   |  + Adds and event listener to the DOM, to trigger toggleAll upon click.

# Version 8 - Getting Data from Inputs #
- Modifies the current implementation of buttons, and adds new buttons.
  \ Refactor of index.html buttons to use "onclick" instead of ID selector.
   |  + Removed id="displayTodosButton" and id="toggleAllButton"
   |  + Added <button onclick="handlers.function()" buttons.
  \ script.js - Implements new object as an interface for the script functions.
   |  + New "handlers" object to call the functions already built in the script.
   |    Enables you to know what will run in script.js by looking at index.html.
   |  + Deletes the id selector based eventListen javascript functions.
   |    This functionality is replaced by the methods of the handlers object.
   |  + New addTodo and ChangeTodo, deleteTodo, and toggleCompleted handlers.
  \ index.html - New Buttons and Inputs
   |  + New "Add" button and an <input> area for the data entry.
   |  + New "Change Todo" with inputs for item index and the new text.
   |  + New "deleteTodo" button and index.
   |  + New "toggleCompleted" button and index.
