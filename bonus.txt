# Version 1 - An Array #
- Creates an array in which to store "todo" string values.
  \ Rather awkwardly verbose command statements accommodate simplistic
   |  alterations of a "todo" list (technically an array of strings).
   |  + todos = ['item 1', 'item 2', 'item 3']

# Version 2 - Functions #
- Codifies the means of array manipulation, through functions.
  \ Permits more readily comprehensible command syntax
   |  + displayTodo()     />    console.log(array[index])
   |  + addTodo()         />    push(todoText)
   |  + changeTodo()      />    array[index] = value
   |  + deleteTodo()      />    splice(position, 1)

# Version 3 - Objects #
- Marries the data structure from V1 with the algorithms from V2.
  \ Implements a new Object Class (todoList) comprised from:
   |  + The "todo" array from V1
   |  + The four functions in V2 (the 'methods' of said Object)

# Version 4 - Booleans #
- Replaces the String property of todoList with a new type of Object.
  \ These Newfangled Objects have Two Properties per Each:
   |  + A String property abstracted from the Object established in V3
   |  + A new Boolean value to represent the Object's state (of completion)
