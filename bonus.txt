Version 1 is based on arrays.
- Creates an array in which to store "todo" string values.
  \ Rather awkwardly verbose command statements accommodate simplistic
    permutations of a "todo" list (technically an array of strings).

Version 2 codifies the means of array manipulation with functions.
- Abstracts Ver. 1's convoluted algorithms into functions.
  \ Constructs more readily comprehensible functions from tedius comand syntax.
    + displayTodo     />    console.log(array[index])
    + addTodo         />    push(todoText)
    + changeTodo      />    array[index] = value
    + deleteTodo      />    splice(position, 1)

Version 3 establishes a new object class.
  - Establishes a new object class
    \ consisting of methods extended from the
    functions used in Ver. 2

Version 4 implements objects from  booleans.
- Transitions from an array of Strings to an array of Objects.
  \ These Newfangled Objects have Two Properties per Each:
    + A string property essentially inherited from Ver. 3
    + A New boolean value to represent the object's state (of completion)
